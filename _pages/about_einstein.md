My name is Momin Siddiqui, and I'm a master's student at `Georgia Institute of Technology`. I work at the [Teachable AI Lab (TAIL)](https://tail.cc.gatech.edu/) as a graduate research assistant, advised by [Dr. Christopher Maclellan](https://chrismaclellan.com/). My research lies at the intersection of AI and EdTech, where I'm developing intelligent tutoring systems.


During my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Jamia Milia Islamia, I worked with [Dr. Jainendra Shukla](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/jainendra) at the Human Machine Interaction lab at IIIT Delhi.

I'm interested in understanding how we can leverage rule based AI and machine learning to build eduction tools for students with disabilties.
